# crypto_transfer project

crypto transfert is a cryptocurrency payment terminal that we designed from scratch:
  - selecting the components and the PIC32
  - schematics and designing the PCB with Altium
  - coding the drivers (I2C, SPI, UART, ... ) in C with Mplab
  - coding the server with Node JS to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
  - coding a hotspot interface in PHP to configure the wifi on the payment terminal
  - proof of concept then prototyping
  - designing the case with Fusion 360
